#RajatProject
The theme of this website is ed-tech where I am selling nutrition courses online on subscription base.
I have used HTML5 , CSS# and javascript foir a development of this site.
I have used multiple tags in css and html like flex, flex-box, slick caraousel etc.
There are four pages in the website  - home page, about us, contact us, blogs in which we have used multiple animations and 
multiple icons from boxicons.
I have also used a sample pictures of my friend and random pictures from website like unsplash.
I have also created a login page with animations.
The website is live at sehatsangnew.netlify.app and also uploaded its files on github
